# Exercise 3: Sorting Customer Orders (DSA)

## Objective
Sort customer orders by `totalPrice` using:
- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort

## Sorting Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm     | Time Complexity (Average) | Time Complexity (Worst) | Space Complexity | Stability | Use Case                     |
|---------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| Bubble Sort   | O(n²)                      | O(n²)                    | O(1)              | Stable    | Simple, small datasets       |
| Quick Sort    | O(n log n)                 | O(n²)                    | O(log n)          | Unstable  | Large, real-time applications|

## Why Quick Sort Is Preferred
- Much faster on average due to divide-and-conquer strategy.
- Bubble Sort does too many comparisons and swaps.
